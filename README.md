# Daniel-Simon's-Cybersecurity-learning-Lab

Hi, I'm *Daniel-Simon*, and I’m passionate about cybersecurity!  
This repository is a collection of my learning materials, hands-on labs, notes, and practice projects as I build my skills in the cybersecurity field.

## What I’m Currently Learning

-  *Splunk* – Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
-  *pfSense* – Open-source firewall/router
-  *Kali Linux* on Virtual Machines – Penetration testing tools
-  *Wireshark* – Network protocol analysis
-  *Nmap* – Network discovery and vulnerability scanning
-  *Python* – Used for writing basic automation scripts, log parsing, simple security tools, and completing labs
-  *SQL* – For querying and managing data

## Purpose of This Repository

- Document my learning journey
- Share notes, configurations, and commands
- Upload practice labs and small projects
- Collaborate with others interested in cybersecurity
  
## working with SQL

Task 1. Retrieve employee device data

- Run the following query to select all device information from the machines table:
- Run the following query to select only the device_id and email_client columns from the machines table. Replace X with device_id and Y with email_client:
- Complete the query to return only the device_id, operating_system, and OS_patch_date columns from the machines table. Replace X, Y, and Z with the columns that you need to return:
  
In this task, information were obtained on employee devices because the team needs to update them. The information needed is in the machines table in the organization database. Below are the images of the tasks performed.


Task 2. Investigate login activity

In this task, information was analyzed from the log_in_attempts table to determine if any unusual activity has occurred.

-  First, you need to investigate the locations where login attempts were made to ensure that they’re in expected areas (the United States, Canada, or Mexico).
-  Write a SQL query that selects the username, login_date, and login_time columns from the log_in_attempts table.
-  Write a SQL query that selects all columns from the log_in_attempts table, using a single symbol after the SELECT keyword.
  
Task 3. Order login attempts data

In this task, you need to use the ORDER BY keyword. You'll sequence the data that your query returns according to the login date and time.

- Run the following query, which orders log_in_attempts data by login_date:
- Modify the query from the previous step by adding the login time to the ORDER BY clause. You must replace X with the appropriate column name:
